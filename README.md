About This App

Welcome to the Monster Hunter Guide, my first mobile app project built with React Native for seamless cross-platform compatibility. This app was created as a learning tool, focusing on navigation techniques using parameters and nested navigation types.
Features and Functionality

    Offline Data Access: To ensure the app functions offline, it utilizes JSON files derived from the Monster Hunter World (MHW) API. While not all data includes photos, placeholders from Lorem Picsum are used where necessary.
    Intuitive Navigation: The primary goal was to create an intuitive navigation experience, making it easy for monster hunters to use the app as a convenient guide.
    Monster Information: The app provides detailed information on various monsters, although some features, like the Monster Rewards section, are still in development.

Development Journey

Building this app has been a valuable learning experience, especially in mastering navigation within React Native. Although some features are incomplete, and the styling could be improved, the project has successfully served its purpose as an educational tool.
Future Plans

I have plans to refine and expand this app in the future. With a new Monster Hunter game expected in 2025, I aim to revisit or possibly remake the app to enhance its functionality and design, providing a comprehensive and polished hunter guide.

Thank you for exploring the Monster Hunter Guide. Stay tuned for future updates and improvements!
